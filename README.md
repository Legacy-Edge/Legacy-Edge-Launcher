# Legacy-Edge-Launcher
This program makes it as simple as a double click (and using UAC one time) to get back to the legacy version of Microsft Edge.<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/ShortDevelopment/Legacy-Edge-Launcher/releases/latest">Download</a>

# How it works
The app sets a registry key as described <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-sysupdate-access-old-edge#side-by-side-experience-with-microsoft-edge-stable-channel-and-microsoft-edge-legacy">here</a> that forces Windows to launch <i>Edge Legacy</i> instead of "<i>The new Edge</i>":   
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate`   
`Allowsxs` = `1`   
If you have the new version already installed you have to launch the new edge installer. The new release (v2) now handels this process automatically wile showing a nice waiting dialog.   
Have a look at the <a href="#if-you-get-a-warning-and-have-the-new-edge-already-installed">following section</a> for more details.   
   
### 20H2 Update âš 
According to [this post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/microsoft-edge-legacy/m-p/1624481/highlight/true#M34656) Legacy Edge Launcher now also deletes this registry key: `SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\ClientState\{56EB18F8-B008-4CBD-B6D2-8C97FE7E9062}` -> `BrowserReplacement`   
   
### Launch
Then the app uses the `IApplicationActivationManager` <i>COM Interface</i> (as describled <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-iapplicationactivationmanager">here</a>) to start <i>Edge Legacy</i> with the following package name:<br/>
`Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe!MicrosoftEdge`<br/>
<br/>
You can find the COM-Refrences in <a href="ShObjIdl_core.header">ShObjIdl_core.h(eader)</a> and the app logic in <a href="ApplicationActivationManager.vb">ApplicationActivationManager.vb</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

# If you get a warning and have the new Edge already installed
No worries! The method below will still work, but after you have launched the app the first time you have to go to `"Settings" -> "Apps"` and there search for `"Edge"`.<br/>
If you click `"Microsoft Edge"` you should see a `"Modify"` Button that will start the Installer of the new Edge. If you reuse the app, the old version of Microsoft Edge should pop up.
